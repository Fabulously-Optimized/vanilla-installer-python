# Planned features

See [https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/milestone/1](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/milestone/1) for issues and improvements which need (or should) to be solved before the full 1.0 release.

## Short-term (minor release)

- Adapt setup scripts for the new requirements of v1.0

## Longer-term (major release)

None.

## Completed

- Add a CLI interface (likely using click)
- A custom profile for FO
  - And therefore, no reliance on `fabric-installer`
- Migrate GUI to PySide6
  - And therefore rewrite the entire GUI
