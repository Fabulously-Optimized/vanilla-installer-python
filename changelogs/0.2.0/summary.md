# v0.2.0 (summary)

We've reached the second beta! Most of the big issues have been fixed, along with a few new features - including support for the OpenDyslexic font! As always, please report any bugs you find on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/issues/new/choose).

We also now compile dev builds for Windows - but these are likely not stable and should not be used unless you are willing to debug the issues. In other words, don't use them unless you are a contributor or tester.
