# v1.0.0-b1 (full)

## New features

- A GUI interface, including light and dark modes powered by [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) ([#31](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/pull/31))
- Automatic download of the required libraries and installation for the Packwiz version of Fabulously Optimized
  - The installation includes installing Fabric and creating a new profile for Fabulously Optimized with its logo
- A JSON file to show what Minecraft versions you can download Fabulously Optimized for

## Known issues

- The font won't apply immediately:

![Font not applying](assets/broken_font.png)

The workaround is to switch the theme twice (it works to just do it once but if you click the button twice you get the same theme).
