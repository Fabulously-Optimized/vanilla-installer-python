# Installation

This varies between platform, so select your OS here:
**[Windows](#windows)** - **[macOS/Linux](#macos-and-linux)****

## Windows

For most users on Windows, we recommend the binary version.

1. Open the [releases page][1] and download the file with the `.exe` extension. (Example: `Vanilla Installer-GUI v0.1.0.exe`)
2. If it asks you where to save your file, select your Downloads folder (`%USERPROFILE%\Downloads`)
3. Navigate to the Downloads folder and double-click the file you just downloaded.
   * If you see a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prompt, click `More info`, then `Run Anyway`.
4. Select the Minecraft version and directory, and click `Install`.
5. You're all done!

## macOS and Linux

*Note: Untested on macOS.*

We have a script to install the Vanilla Installer for you, instead of going through a complicated process.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Paste this command in (with Ctrl+Shift+V) and then press Enter: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -`.
Be aware that this executes the script as soon as it is downloaded. If you want to look at the contents of said script first, you can look at [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/blob/main/scripts/install.sh).
