# Information, tips and notices for developers

## General developing information

As this project is written in Python, you will need Python installed. The current recommended version is Python 3.10, however it should work on Python 3.8 and anything newer.
We have a [`gitpod`](https://gitpod.io) configuration, so click this to be automatically teleported to gitpod with development all ready for you.

## Avoiding 404s

This one might be obvious, but please keep in mind to ALWAYS `Ctrl+F` before renaming a file!

## Tested on...

- Linux â†’ Debian â†’ Ubuntu â†’ PopOS:
  - My main system, should work 100% fine
- Windows 11
  - [osfanbuff63](https://github.com/osfanbuff63)'s main system, should work fine

## Recommendations

The program is optimized for Python 3.8 and above, as well as Linux and Windows.

- `darkdetect`
  - Used to check whether the OS theme is dark or not
    - Supports:
      - macOS 10.14+
      - Windows 10 1607+
      - Linux with a dark GTK theme.
    - Don't meed these requirements? Don't worry! The code will still work, just dark mode will not be detected.
