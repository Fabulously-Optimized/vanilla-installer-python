  You need to log into GitHub, if you haven't already.
  
- If you're a **developer**, you can also help by either
  [reviewing existing Pull Requests](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/pulls) or
  [forking this project](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/fork) and

- As of right now, we do not support **translations**, but you are welcome to implement such feature if you're a developer!

- As FO does not accept monetary contributions besides browsing or downloading on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized) (respectively), VanillaInstaller does not accept them either.

[More ways to support (some of them involve the modpack itself)](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Thanks a lot! :heart:

## Packaging

So, you'd like to add VI to a package manager that it isn't in yet. Great!

Before you start, make sure to check it doesn't exist in said package manager, even if it isn't listed [on the README](README.md#package-managers) :wink:

Here's the information you can file it under:
