  You need to log into GitHub, if you haven't already.
  
- If you're a **developer**, you can also help by either
  [reviewing existing Pull Requests](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/pulls) or
  [forking this project](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer/fork) and

- As of right now, we do not support **translations**, but you are welcome to implement such feature if you're a developer!

- As FO does not accept monetary contributions besides browsing or downloading on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized) (respectively), Vanilla Installer does not accept them either.

Thanks a lot! :heart:

## Packaging

So, you'd like to add VI to a package manager that it isn't in yet. Great!
