# Planned features

## Short-term (minor release)

- A custom profile for FO
  - And therefore, no reliance on `fabric-installer`
- Adapt setup scripts for the new requirements of v1.0

## Longer-term (major release)

- Migrate GUI to PySide6
  - And therefore rewrite the entire GUI
- Add a CLI interface (likely using click)
